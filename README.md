# TrustMedQA: Scientific Verifier for LLM-Generated Medical Answers

I developed an end-to-end hallucination detection tool for medical LLM answers using **Google Gemini Flash**, **FAISS**, **BioBERT embeddings**, and **BioClinicalBERT-based entailment models**. This system is built with a **Streamlit interface** and enables users to check if answers generated by LLMs in medical contexts are **factually supported or hallucinated**, using scientific literature as evidence.

This project addresses the rising concern of **LLM hallucinations in high-stakes domains** like healthcare by combining claim extraction, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and natural language inference (NLI).

---

##  Project Workflow

- The user submits a **medical question** via the Streamlit interface.
- The system uses **Google Gemini** to generate an answer and extract 2–4 supporting claims.
- Claims are passed to a **retriever**, which searches for evidence in the **PubMedQA dataset** using **BioBERT embeddings + FAISS**.
- Each claim is then analyzed using an **entailment model** (BioClinicalBERT) to determine if it is:
  -  Entailed (supported),
  -  Contradicted,
  -  Neutral (unverifiable).
- The system aggregates results and outputs a final verdict:
  - `Supported`, `Hallucinated`, or `Unverifiable`

## 💬 Example Questions

- What are the side effects of metformin in elderly patients?
- Does aspirin reduce the risk of stroke in diabetic individuals?
- Is there any link between vitamin D deficiency and depression?

##  Sample Logic (Hallucination Verdict)

The verdict is determined based on:
- Ratio of claims that are strongly entailed,
- Number and confidence of contradictions,
- Presence of only neutral evidence.

### Verdict Categories:
-  Supported — strong scientific evidence backs the claims.
-  Hallucinated — multiple claims are contradicted or weakly supported.
-  Unverifiable — claims are neutral, lacking strong support or contradiction.
